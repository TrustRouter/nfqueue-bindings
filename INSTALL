Prerequisites
-------------

cmake
libnetfilter-queue
swig
python development files
perl development files

You'll also need a fairly recent kernel (>= 2.6.18 to work, but some
functions such as set_qmax_len require a kernel >= 2.6.20).

Compilation
-----------

A Makefile has been written to wrap cmake call

Running 'make' will:

 - Create a subdirectory build/
 - Go in that directory and call cmake ..
 - Call make to build the librairies

If the pkg-config files for libnetfilter-queue are in a non-standard
directory, export the following variable before calling make::

 export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/prefix/lib/pkgconfig/

To remove the build files, run 'make clean' or just remove the build
directory.

Installation
------------

Edit the toplevel makefile, and set the PREFIX variable::

 PREFIX = /usr/local

or, alternatively, set the contents of the value when running make::

 make
 make PREFIX=/usr/local install
